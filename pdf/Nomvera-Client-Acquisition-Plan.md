## The One Truth Before Everything Else

Most B2B companies fail at marketing because they try to reach everyone. You don't need a thousand leads. You need **12 right conversations** to close your first $500K in revenue.

Your buyer is not a marketing team. Your buyer is one of these three people:
- **Head of Post-Training / Head of RLHF** at a frontier AI lab
- **VP of AI / Director of AI Engineering** at an enterprise building internal models
- **Research Scientist who controls vendor budget** at a mid-tier AI lab

There are roughly **4,000–6,000 of these people on earth right now.** You know who they work for. You can find every single one of them by name on LinkedIn. This is not a mass marketing problem. This is a precision hunting problem.

Everything in this plan follows that logic.

---

## PHASE 1: THE FOUNDATION (Week 1–2)
### Build the Machine Before You Use It

You cannot generate trust in a $50K–$200K B2B sale without digital credibility. Before any outreach, build these four assets. They are free and they take one week.

---

### 1. LinkedIn — Your Most Important Asset

**The Founder's LinkedIn Profile (Your Personal Account)**

This is your #1 sales tool. Prospects Google you before they respond to anything. Your profile must say: *this person knows what they're talking about.*

Do these changes today:

**Headline**: Don't say "Founder at Nomvera AI." Instead write:
> *"Helping frontier AI labs get RLHF data from verified U.S. graduate-degree annotators | Nomvera AI"*

LinkedIn's new AI search (launched Nov 2025) surfaces profiles by *what problem you solve*, not your job title. This headline makes you discoverable when someone types "RLHF annotation vendor" in LinkedIn search.

**About Section** — Write this in first person, 3 short paragraphs:
- Paragraph 1: The problem you saw in the market (crowdsourced annotation failing expert tasks)
- Paragraph 2: What Nomvera does and who it's for (specifically: "frontier AI labs and enterprises building internal models")
- Paragraph 3: What to do next ("If you're evaluating AI training vendors, DM me or book a 20-minute call")

**Featured Section**: Link directly to nomvera.autoneties.com.

**Nomvera AI Company Page**

Create it. Even if it only has 10 followers, prospects check. A company with no page looks like a freelancer, not a firm.

Banner image: Your headline tagline from the website.
About: Two sentences — what you do, who for. Include keywords: RLHF, model evaluation, AI training data, human feedback, post-training.

Post once per week minimum on the company page. More on what to post below.

---

### 2. Build Your Target Account List (TAL)

This is your hit list. Every single thing you do for the next 6 months feeds into this list.

**Tier 1 — Priority Targets (25–40 companies)**
These are companies actively spending on AI training data right now:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Mistral, Cohere, AI21 Labs, Inflection, xAI, Stability AI
- Amazon (Alexa AI), Apple (Siri LLM team), Microsoft (Copilot post-training), Salesforce AI
- Mid-tier labs: Together AI, Perplexity, Imbue, Character AI, Adept, Harvey AI (legal), Hippocratic AI (medical)

**Tier 2 — Enterprise AI Teams (40–60 companies)**
Large companies building internal models who need vendor independence:
- Goldman Sachs AI, JPMorgan AI, Bloomberg AI, BlackRock
- Mayo Clinic AI, Epic Systems, Tempus AI
- Lockheed Martin AI, Palantir, Booz Allen Hamilton

**Tier 3 — Mid-Market AI Startups (100+ companies)**
Well-funded Series B/C AI companies that have model teams and need training data. Find them on Crunchbase by searching "AI" + raised $20M+ in last 18 months.

**How to build this list for free:**
1. Go to LinkedIn. Search: "Head of Post-Training" → filter by company size 50–5000 employees
2. Search: "Director of RLHF" — you will find exact buyers
3. Search: "Research Scientist, Post-Training" at OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere etc.
4. Crunchbase Free Tier: search AI companies, filter by funding round, copy company names
5. Save every name in a Google Sheet: Name / Title / Company / LinkedIn URL / Tier / Status / Last Contact

This list is your business. Treat it like a database, not a to-do list.

---

### 3. Set Up Google Alerts (5 minutes, free forever)

Go to google.com/alerts and create alerts for these exact phrases:
- `"Scale AI" vendor alternatives`
- `RLHF annotation quality problems`
- `AI training data vendor`
- `post-training data outsource`
- `model evaluation vendor`

Every time someone writes about these topics — a blog post, a Reddit thread, a tweet, a news article — you get an email. That is a warm lead signal. Act on it within 24 hours.

---

## PHASE 2: CONTENT THAT CLOSES DEALS (Week 3 onwards, ongoing)

Here is the secret most B2B companies miss: **your content is your sales team.**

When a Head of Post-Training at Cohere sees your LinkedIn post about RLHF annotation quality problems, they don't think "interesting." They think: *"This person understands our problem. I should talk to them."*

That is the only job of your content: make the right 50 people think you understand their problem better than anyone else.

---

### The LinkedIn Content Machine

Post **3 times per week** on your personal LinkedIn. Not the company page — your personal account. People buy from people, not logos. At this stage you are Nomvera.

**Post Type 1 — The Insight Post (Monday)**
One observation about the AI training market that most people haven't articulated. No fluff. Just your clear point of view.

Examples:
> *"The Scale-Meta situation isn't just a PR problem for Scale. It's a governance crisis for every AI lab that let a single vendor touch their post-training data. Here's what that actually means for vendor selection in 2025..."*

> *"We audited 200 preference annotation tasks done by crowd-platform contributors against the same tasks done by domain-credentialed annotators. The inter-annotator agreement gap was 23 percentage points. That gap is your model's quality ceiling. Let me show you the numbers..."*

> *"Everyone in AI talks about data quality. Almost no one measures what 'quality' actually means for RLHF tasks. Here are the 3 metrics that actually matter — and why most vendors aren't tracking any of them."*

**Post Type 2 — The Credibility Post (Wednesday)**
Behind-the-scenes content about your process, your team, your vetting methodology. This is social proof without testimonials.

Examples:
> *"Our annotator credential verification process — what we check, why we check it, and what we reject. A thread."*

> *"A master's candidate in computational linguistics just completed their calibration evaluation for our NLP annotation pool. Here's what the scoring looked like and what we flagged."*

**Post Type 3 — The Direct Value Post (Friday)**
Teach something. Give away knowledge that your buyer finds useful. This creates the most reach.

Examples:
> *"A framework for evaluating RLHF vendor quality in 3 questions. Feel free to use these on us too."*

> *"The 5 red flags in an AI annotation vendor proposal. Number 3 nobody talks about."*

> *"How to write an RLHF rubric your annotators can actually follow. Most are too vague to be useful."*

**Format Rules:**
- First line must stop the scroll. No "I am pleased to share..." — open with the tension or the data.
- Write like you talk. Short sentences. Line breaks. No paragraphs longer than 3 lines.
- End every post with one question or one call to action. "What's your experience been with annotation quality?" or "DM me if you want the full framework."
- No hashtag spam. Maximum 3 relevant hashtags if any.
- Respond to every comment within 2 hours for the first 48 hours. The algorithm rewards engagement velocity.

---

### The Long-Form Play: LinkedIn Articles + Substack

Once per month, write a 1,000–1,500 word piece on a topic your buyer cares about. These rank in Google and build authority over time.

Article ideas:
- *"Why crowdsourced annotation fails on RLHF tasks: a technical breakdown"*
- *"Post-Scale AI: how frontier labs are restructuring their training data supply chain"*
- *"The annotator credentialing problem in AI: what the industry gets wrong and why it matters"*
- *"Inter-annotator agreement as a product quality metric — a guide for research leads"*

Publish on LinkedIn Articles AND copy to a free Substack. The Substack builds an email list over time — which is an asset you own, unlike LinkedIn followers.

---

## PHASE 3: THE OUTREACH ENGINE (Week 3 onwards)

Content warms the market. Outreach closes deals. You need both.

---

### The LinkedIn Outreach System

This is the exact sequence that gets responses from senior AI researchers and research leads. It is different from typical B2B sales because your buyers are highly skeptical of cold sales messages. The only thing they respond to is demonstrated expertise.

**Step 1 — Follow + Engage (Days 1–3)**
Before sending any connection request:
- Follow the person's LinkedIn activity
- Leave a genuinely useful comment on one of their recent posts. Not "Great insight!" — actually engage with the content. Add a data point, a counter-perspective, or a question.
- This is called *social warming*. It makes your name recognizable before you reach out.

**Step 2 — Connection Request (Day 4)**
Send a connection request with a personalized note. Keep it under 300 characters (LinkedIn limit).

Template:
> *"Hi [Name] — saw your post on [specific topic]. We work specifically on [relevant problem they mentioned]. Worth connecting."*

Never pitch in the connection request. Never.

**Step 3 — First Message After Connection (Day 6–7)**
Wait 2–3 days after they accept. Then send:

> *"Thanks for connecting, [Name].*
>
> *I noticed [specific thing: their company is building X, they posted about Y problem, their team recently grew]. That's actually exactly the problem space Nomvera was built for.*
>
> *We staff AI training and evaluation projects exclusively with U.S. graduate-degree annotators — calibrated in your domain before a single production task. The reason we built it this way is [one sentence on the problem you solve].*
>
> *Happy to send over a one-pager if it's relevant. Or not — totally understand if the timing is off."*

What this message does right:
- It references something specific (shows you're not spamming)
- It's short enough to read in 20 seconds
- It ends with low pressure ("or not")
- It offers a next step without demanding a meeting immediately

**Step 4 — Follow-Up (Day 14)**
If no response, one follow-up only:

> *"Following up briefly — wanted to share something that might be directly relevant to your team: [attach or link to one specific piece of content — a blog post, a one-pager, or a specific stat].*
>
> *If this isn't the right time or person, happy to connect with whoever handles training data vendor relationships."*

**Step 5 — Exit (Day 21)**
If still no response:
> *"No worries at all — I'll stay in touch via LinkedIn content. If anything changes on the vendor side, you know where to find us."*

Then move to "nurture" — they stay in your Target Account List, you comment on their content occasionally, and you reach out again in 60 days with something new.

**Daily Outreach Targets:**
- Send 10 new connection requests per day (LinkedIn limit is ~20/day before risk of restriction)
- 5 warm follow-up messages to existing connections
- 5 genuine comments on target buyer posts
- This takes 45 minutes per day. It is the most valuable 45 minutes of your day.

---

### Cold Email — The Hidden Channel

LinkedIn is warm. Email is faster volume. You need both.

**How to find professional emails for free:**
- Hunter.io (free tier: 25 searches/month) — type company domain + name → get email
- Apollo.io (free tier: 50 credits/month) — better database for AI companies
- RocketReach free tier
- Directly from LinkedIn "Contact Info" if they've listed email
- Guess the pattern: most companies use firstname@company.com or firstname.lastname@company.com — verify with Hunter.

**Cold Email Formula (5 sentences max):**

> Subject: RLHF annotation quality at [Company]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I know your team is running RLHF evaluation workflows — probably with a mix of vendors and internal tooling. The quality ceiling problem with crowd-based platforms is something we've built specifically around.
>
> Nomvera staffs AI training projects exclusively with U.S. graduate-degree holders, calibrated in your domain before a single production task. We're working with a few labs right now on preference data and model evaluation.
>
> Worth a 15-minute call this week to see if there's a fit?
>
> [Name]

Subject line variations that get opened:
- *"Your post-training data vendor — a question"*
- *"After Scale-Meta: who's handling your RLHF evaluation?"*
- *"Graduate-credentialed annotators for [Company]'s [specific domain] work"*
- *"15 minutes on annotation quality at [Company]?"*

**What not to do:**
- Don't attach anything to cold emails. It triggers spam filters.
- Don't use "I hope this finds you well." Ever.
- Don't send from a free Gmail. Use your @autoneties.com or @nomvera.com domain.
- Don't follow up more than twice. Three emails and you're spam.

---

## PHASE 4: COMMUNITY INFILTRATION (Ongoing)

Your buyers are concentrated in very specific online communities. These are where deals actually begin — not on your website.

---

### Communities to Join and Participate In

**Slack/Discord Communities (Join all of these free):**
- **Alignment Forum / LessWrong** — where AI safety researchers and post-training teams discuss model alignment. Participate thoughtfully. Never pitch.
- **Hugging Face Discord** — active ML practitioner community. Watch for people discussing annotation, evaluation, RLHF.
- **MLOps Community Slack** — 20,000+ ML engineers. Channels like #data-quality and #evaluation are directly relevant.
- **AI Alignment Slack** — researchers working on model alignment, which requires human feedback data.
- **Latent Space Discord** — popular AI engineering community. Highly technical audience, exactly your buyer.

**Reddit (Monitor and occasionally participate):**
- r/MachineLearning — 2.8M members. Post useful content here and it gets seen by the right people.
- r/LocalLLaMA — ML practitioners building fine-tuned models. They discuss annotation quality regularly.
- r/singularity, r/artificial — broader AI discussion but decision-makers lurk here

**Strategy for communities:** Don't advertise. Don't post your website. Instead, answer questions about RLHF, annotation, training data quality. Become the person who gives genuinely useful answers. When someone asks "how do you ensure annotation quality at scale?" — give a real, detailed answer. Your name, and by extension Nomvera, becomes associated with expertise. Then when they need a vendor, they remember you.

---

### Newsletters and Podcasts to Target

Getting mentioned in a newsletter your buyers read is worth 1,000 LinkedIn posts.

**Newsletters your buyers read:**
- **The Batch (deeplearning.ai)** — Andrew Ng's newsletter. Email them with a data point or story angle.
- **Import AI (Jack Clark)** — widely read by AI researchers. Pitch a perspective piece.
- **The Gradient** — academic/practitioner ML publication. Contribute a guest piece on annotation quality.
- **Interconnects (Nathan Lambert)** — RLHF-focused newsletter. Directly your audience. Reach out.
- **TLDR AI** — 500K+ subscribers. Pitch a guest post or get featured in their "Tools" section.

**Podcasts to pitch yourself as a guest:**
- Latent Space Podcast
- Practical AI (Changelog)
- The TWIML AI Podcast
- No Priors (Andreessen Horowitz AI)
- Gradient Dissent (Weights & Biases)

Your pitch: *"I can talk about the human credentialing problem in AI training data — specifically why frontier model quality hits a ceiling when annotation is crowdsourced. I have operational data on IAA gaps between crowd and credentialed contributors."*

---

## PHASE 5: THE TROJAN HORSE — FREE CONTENT ASSETS

These are pieces of content you create once and they generate inbound leads for months.

---

### Asset 1: The Industry Report (Most Powerful Free Asset)

Title: **"The State of AI Annotation Quality: What 500 RLHF Tasks Reveal About Crowd vs. Credentialed Contributors"**

You run 500 tasks through your own annotators. You compare inter-annotator agreement scores by domain. You publish the findings as a free PDF report.

Every research lead who downloads this report is a warm lead. Every lab that cites it builds your credibility. Every journalist who covers it gives you a backlink and a mention.

Promote it by:
- Publishing the executive summary as a LinkedIn article
- Posting 3 data highlights as separate posts with "full report in comments"
- Emailing it directly to your Tier 1 target list as a value-first touchpoint
- Submitting it to Hugging Face Datasets or Papers With Code as a methodology note
- Pitching it to the newsletters listed above as newsworthy content

This asset alone can generate your first 5 inbound conversations.

**You don't even need 500 real tasks to publish this.** You can structure it as a methodology paper and run a pilot set of 50 tasks. The rigor of the methodology matters more than sample size in your first version.

---

### Asset 2: The Vendor Evaluation Framework

Title: **"How to Evaluate an AI Annotation Vendor: 12 Questions Every Research Lead Should Ask"**

Make it a one-page PDF. Gated behind an email capture form on your website.

This is brilliant because:
- It pre-qualifies buyers (anyone who downloads it is actively evaluating vendors)
- It positions you as the standard-setter (your criteria happen to be exactly what Nomvera offers)
- It is genuinely useful, so people share it

Distribute via LinkedIn, Reddit (r/MachineLearning), and direct email.

---

### Asset 3: The Case Study (Even Without Clients Yet)

Before your first real case study, publish a **hypothetical scenario** framed as a process walkthrough:

Title: **"How We'd Staff a 2,000-Task RLHF Evaluation Project for a Legal Reasoning Model — A Detailed Walkthrough"**

Walk through exactly what Nomvera would do: the intake process, the credential matching, the calibration exercise, the quality reporting. Make it specific and operational.

This does two things: it demonstrates process maturity to skeptical buyers, and it generates SEO for search terms like "RLHF annotation vendor" and "model evaluation outsourcing."

---

## PHASE 6: THE CLOSE — HOW TO CONVERT CONVERSATIONS TO CONTRACTS

Getting someone on a call is 30% of the job. Converting that call is the other 70%.

---

### The Discovery Call Framework

You have 20–30 minutes. This is the sequence:

**Minutes 1–3: Establish context**
*"Before I tell you anything about Nomvera, I want to understand your situation. What does your current annotation workflow look like — are you using a platform, internal team, or a combination?"*

Listen. Take notes. They will tell you exactly what's wrong.

**Minutes 4–12: Go deeper on the problem**
*"You mentioned [specific thing they said]. How often does that cause rework? What does that cost you in time or budget per month?"*

You are making them feel the pain of the status quo. You are not pitching yet.

**Minutes 13–20: Show the solution through the lens of their specific problem**
*"Based on what you've described — specifically the [X problem they named] — here's exactly how Nomvera would handle that..."*

Reference their domain specifically. If they're working on code evaluation, tell them about your software engineering graduate contributors. If they're working on medical reasoning, tell them about your biomedical sciences pool.

**Minutes 21–25: The proposal conversation**
*"If this sounds like a fit, the next step is a project brief from your side — domain, task type, volume, timeline. We turn that around into a full proposal in 48 hours. Does that work as a next step?"*

Always leave with a specific next action that has a deadline. Never leave with "we'll be in touch."

---

### Pricing Psychology for Early Clients

You are new. You don't have 50 case studies. The way you overcome that objection is through a **Pilot Project Structure:**

Offer your first 3 clients a structured pilot:
- 200–500 tasks
- Fixed price, below your standard rate (but not embarrassingly low)
- Full quality reporting included
- Explicit statement: *"This is our pilot engagement structure. It's how we demonstrate our process before a larger commitment. We've priced it to remove the risk from your side."*

The pilot does three things: it removes buyer risk, it gives you a real case study, and it gives you a paying client relationship to expand.

**Never work for free.** Even at a reduced pilot rate, paid engagements create accountability on both sides. Free trials create the wrong dynamic.

---

## THE 90-DAY PLAN: WHAT TO DO EACH WEEK

**Weeks 1–2: Foundation**
- LinkedIn profile overhaul (personal + company page)
- Build Tier 1 Target Account List (25 companies, 2–3 contacts each)
- Set up Google Alerts
- Write your first 3 LinkedIn posts (schedule them)

**Weeks 3–4: Outreach Launch**
- Begin 10 connection requests/day to Tier 1 list
- Send first wave of direct messages (20 people)
- Join 3 Slack/Discord communities — spend 15 min/day reading, not posting yet
- Publish Week 1 of content calendar

**Weeks 5–8: Build Momentum**
- Post 3x/week on LinkedIn without fail
- 50 total outreach contacts now in pipeline
- Begin writing the Industry Report
- First cold email campaign to Tier 2 list (use Apollo free tier)
- Start leaving comments in communities
- Target: 5 discovery calls booked

**Weeks 9–12: Convert**
- Industry Report published and distributed
- Vendor Evaluation Framework live on website with email capture
- Pitch 2 newsletters as a guest contributor
- Target: 2 pilot proposals sent
- Target: 1 signed pilot agreement

**Month 4–6:**
- First pilot delivered with quality report
- Case study written from pilot (with client permission)
- Retainer conversation with pilot client
- Content velocity increasing — you now have data and stories to write about
- Target: $50K–$100K in signed revenue

---

## THE SECRET NOBODY TELLS YOU

You asked for the secret. Here it is.

**The fastest path to your first client is not marketing. It is referrals from someone your buyer already trusts.**

Before anything else, identify 5–10 people who are one degree away from your buyers:
- Professors at U.S. CS graduate programs whose students you're placing
- AI investors who write checks into frontier labs
- Former Scale AI or Appen employees who have contacts at labs
- ML engineers who recently left a lab to join a startup (they're connected to everyone)
- AI conference organizers (NeurIPS, ICML, ACL have communities)

Reach out to these people with a very specific ask: *"I'm not asking you to introduce me to everyone. Just — is there one person you know who's frustrated with their current annotation vendor? I'd love a warm introduction."*

One warm introduction is worth 200 cold emails. A word from someone your buyer trusts eliminates every objection about being new and unproven.

The fastest path to $1M ARR is: 3 warm intros → 3 pilot clients → 3 case studies → inbound begins.

Everything else in this plan accelerates you to that moment and builds the machine that runs after it.

## FINAL WORD

Nomvera has one genuine, durable advantage: you have the talent before you have the revenue. Most services companies have the clients before they have the talent. You have it backwards — in the best possible way.

That means every conversation you have, you can say with complete confidence: *"Our team is ready. We can be in scoping within 48 hours."* That is rare. Use it.

The work is the consistency. Content three times a week. Ten outreach contacts a day. One genuine community interaction daily. That is 90 minutes of work. Do it every single day for 90 days and the pipeline will be full.
